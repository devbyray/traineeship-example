# Project 1: Static Bakery Homepage (Weeks 1-3)

## Goal
Build a responsive static homepage for a bakery based on a provided design, focusing on HTML, CSS, Git collaboration, and deployment.

## Core Skills
- HTML5 & Semantic Markup
- CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid, Responsive Design, CSS Variables)
- Git & GitHub Workflow (Branches, Pull Requests, Code Reviews)
- Pair Programming & Collaboration
- Task Breakdown (User Stories)
- Static Site Deployment (Netlify/Vercel)

## Tasks

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Each trainee creates a new repository on their personal GitHub account.
    *   Set up the project for pair programming. Add your coach as collaborator to your repository so he can perform reviews.
    *   Initialize the project with a basic `index.html` and `style.css`.
2.  **Design Analysis & Task Breakdown:**
    *   Analyze the design: [Bistro Bakery Website on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/24188035-Bistro-Bakery-Website) 
        ![Screenshot design](https://cdn.dribbble.com/userupload/14624010/file/original-f799fc6a646cfb624bb7aae32f3ac852.jpg?resize=752x&vertical=center)
    *   Break down the design into smaller features/components (e.g., Header, Hero Section, Menu Highlights, Footer).
    *   Write these features as User Stories in a simple format (e.g., "As a user, I want to see the navigation menu so that I can browse the site"). Create GitHub Issues for these stories.
    *   Create a GitHub [Project Board to track progress](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/creating-projects/creating-a-project#updating-your-project-description-and-readme). 
3.  **Implementation (HTML & CSS):**
    *   Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your computer. At least version 22.0.0. and preferably with NVM ([MacOS/Linux](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)).
    *   Setup the project with Vite. Use this command to create a new Vite project:
        ```bash
        npm create vite@latest bakery-website --template vanilla
        ```
    *   Translate the design into HTML structure, focusing on semantics.
    *   Style the page using CSS. Prioritize responsive design (mobile-first approach recommended).
    *   Use Git branches for each feature/user story. Create Pull Requests for review before merging.
4.  **Collaboration:**
    *   Practice pair programming effectively.
    *   Perform code reviews on each other's Pull Requests.
5.  **Deployment:**
    *   Connect the GitHub repository to Netlify or Vercel.
    *   Set up automatic deployment from the main branch.
    *   Ensure the live site matches the design and is responsive.

## Deliverables
- A GitHub repository containing the project code.
- A list of User Stories as GitHub Issues.
- A deployed, responsive static website hosted on Netlify or Vercel.
- A clean Git history demonstrating branching and PRs.
- *Refer to [EVALUATION.md](./EVALUATION.md) for specific assessment criteria.*
